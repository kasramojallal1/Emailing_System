# emailing-system

This project is a mailing system. There is a MariaDB database in which users' data are stored. Users are able to send and receive emails.
This database has many procedures(functions), so in order to do a specific task, all there is to do is call that procedure with specific inputs.

The user interface is created by pyQt5. The Python code is mostly the design of the interface and calling the procedures of the database.
